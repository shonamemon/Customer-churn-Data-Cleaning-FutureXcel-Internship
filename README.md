# Customer Churn – Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a real-world customer churn dataset using Python. The main objective of this work was to prepare raw customer data for analysis by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies.

Customer churn data is commonly used in business analytics to understand why customers leave a service. Preparing clean and reliable data is an important step before any analysis or machine learning modeling.

## Dataset Overview
- Dataset: Customer Churn Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Type: Business and customer behavior data

The dataset includes customer information such as tenure, services used, payment method, monthly charges, and churn status.

## Work Performed
The following steps were completed using Python in Google Colab:

- Loaded the dataset and explored its structure
- Checked missing values and data consistency
- Handled missing values using mean and mode
- Corrected incorrect data types
- Detected and treated outliers
- Verified the final cleaned dataset
- Saved the cleaned dataset as a CSV file

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
